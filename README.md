### Hello World!
Greetings, Hacker!
I present to you my React+Typescript+TailwindCSS+REST API Web Application in which Hook useSearchParams and fake data base with 12 paint Products are included. To fetch all data I used Axios tool, because it performs great in this sort of applications. 
### How to start?
Please, clone my app and type in terminal "npm install" command if you select apps' folder. After that, you can type "npm start" command so you could view my application through web browser. Have fun and send me some feedback, if you please.
